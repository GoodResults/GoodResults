// For years, rumors of the Marsh Girl have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in
/*  * 5 Stars, easily! *

    WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a gentle yet symbolic depiction of the valiant survival of Kya Clarka reclusive young girl who has been abandoned by her parents, siblings, school system, the entire town surrounding her, and what ultimately feels like life itself.;

I can see now
This is a real controversial book to be hated or to be wholeheartedly loved. I was at the team of deeply in lovers. And I know most of the good readers couldnt finish it. But if they also give it a shot to try the audiobook read by Cassandra Campbell, Im positively sure that they will love the story and all the nature parts because this is not only Marsh Girls heart-wrenching, sad, poignant, poetic story, but this is also about nature.

When you listen to this book, you feel like the story is
